## Measuring work in lines of code
I know, I know... Measuring the work that someone did in lines of code is a bad
practice.

There are days where I can easy write **300+** lines and there are others where I
don't even write **10** because I'm debugging and stuck in a problem for hours.

This is **not** a program for lines-of-code-competition.
