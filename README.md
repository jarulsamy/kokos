kokos is a multi-use Python package which includes all of my public Python packages.

Supports Python 3.

Installation ([pip page](https://pypi.org/project/kokos/)):

```
pip install kokos
```
You can use it like a normal package or from the command like (see [examples.md](examples.md "examples.md")):
```python
from kokos import cpu_stress_test
score = cpu_stress_test.Start()
print(score)
```
